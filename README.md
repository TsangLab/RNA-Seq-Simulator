#RNA-Seq-Simulator

A suite of Python programs to produce simulated Illumina RNA-Seq reads with a high level of realism. The starting positions of the reads and the distributions of read errors and quality codes are all empirically derived from real RNA-Seq datasets.

The suite includes Python scripts to prepare the empirical read creation probability and read error distribution tables, and to generate and postprocess the simulated reads.



**RNA-Seq-Simulator** is available [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/rnaseqsimulator/)
